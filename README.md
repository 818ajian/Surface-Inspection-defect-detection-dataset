# Surface defect datasets #

Resherchers of surface defect often suffer from the lack of the corresponding dataset.  
Thanks to the data provider's generous support, we can collect these datasets. 

You can download some of these datasets which are modified by us, they are in the zip files in this project. Others datasets you can vist the links we provide.

**The image datasets are only for academic research, no commercial purposes is allowed. If you use any datasets, please cite the paper of the corresponding  provider!!!**

There are several different surfaces, each surface contains one or several defects. For image segmentation, object detection, saliency detection, classification, etc.

**The image datasets are:**


----------
# Cracks on the surface of the construction. #

Cracks on bridge(left) and crak on the road surface.



-  Bridge cracks. There are 2688 images of  bridge crack without pixel level ground truth. From the athours  "Liangfu Li Weifei Ma  Li Li Xiaoxiao Gao".  Files can be reached by visiting [https://github.com/maweifei/Bridge_Crack_Image_Data](https://github.com/maweifei/Bridge_Crack_Image_Data).

-  Crack on road surface. From Shi, Yong and Cui, Limeng and Qi, Zhiquan and Meng, Fan and Chen, Zhensong. Original dataset can be reached at [https://github.com/cuilimeng/CrackForest-dataset](https://github.com/cuilimeng/CrackForest-dataset). **We extract the image files of the pixel level ground truth.**

# Steel surface defects #

These Datasets from Kechen Song, Northeastern University (NEU). You can visted they Home page [http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/me/songkc/Vision-based_SIS_Steel.html](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/me/songkc/Vision-based_SIS_Steel.html) to download 1800 images, examples like figure below:

- these 6 class NEU surface defect dataset has only the image level label, no pixel level Ground truth.

- Their "Micro surface defect database" and "Oil pollution defect database" are labeled with  pixel level **ground truth by us**.
